          <p><h4>4.Travelling experience</h4>

				I travelled to France for one month as an au-pair. I stayed in a village called Chevreuse just less than an hour outside Paris. I went to gain work experience in the Primary School and 'After School', to expand my speaking and listening in the french language, to learn more about the french culture and day to day life and also I was an Au pair to two children aged 7 and 10 I was staying with for the month. I went to the Primary School for a week where I helped the Teachers and watched over the children in the yard at lunch break. I attended the' After School' which I minded the children from the ages of 3 to 10 years of age and finished a 7pm. In the 'After School' I also helped make the  Lunch for the children. When the parents of the family I was staying with were at work I did a lot of the cleaning around the house such as hoovering, mopping, hanging out clothes to dry, making the beds and tidying and organising the main rooms of the house. I made a lot of lunches and dinners  for the children when they came back from school and after their activities. And every night I helped them with their homework. For one week I attended School for my own age group. I joined in in many classes and activities and really enjoyed myself. I feel that my time in France made me more confident and independent as a person.

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
